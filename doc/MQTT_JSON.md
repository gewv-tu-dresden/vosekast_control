# MQTT and JSON

The MQTT protocol is used to send commands to Vosekast as well as to publish sensor data.
We decided to use the JSON:API for its ease of use, flexibility and lightweight design to encode and decode all MQTT messages.

## JSON payload format

* There are different classes to distinguish between sensor data/ logs/ commands/ error messages. Each class will publish to a separate topic under /vosekast for easier differentiation.
	* Sensors publish to their on topic under /status, i.e. vosekast/status/Stock_Tank 
	* Standard Log events will publish to /log, i.e. vosekast/log
	* Log events with level "Error" or "Critical" publish to /error, i.e. vosekast/error/Stock_Tank
	* Vosekast is listening for commands on /command, i.e. vosekast/command/Stock_Tank
* Data is distinguished by sensor_id and timestamp.
